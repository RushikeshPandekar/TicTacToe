            Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in
            one of the nine spaces in the grid.Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a
            draw. Hence, tic-tac-toe is often played by young children who may not have discovered the optimal strategy.
            Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts
            of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees.
            It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765
            essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations
            and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space.[1] If played optimally by both players, the game
            always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game

            <ul>
                <li>Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.</li>
                <li>Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the
                    opponent.</li>
                <li>Fork: Cause a scenario where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).</li>
                <li>Blocking an opponent's fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should
                    block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to
                    make two in a row. Otherwise, the player should make a two in a row to force the opponent into
                    defending, as long as it does not result in them producing a fork. For example, if "X" has two
                    opposite corners and "O" has the center, "O" must not play a corner move to win. (Playing a corner
                    move in this scenario produces a fork for "X" to win.)</li>
                <li>Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives
                    the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice;
                    however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)</li>
                <li>Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.</li>
                <li>Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.</li>
                <li>Empty side: The player plays in a middle square on any of the four sides.</li>
            </ul>
